## Email Topic Modeling

This project aims to develop an unsupervised email topic identifier model. This model utilizes a doc2vec model to embed textual features of the email sender, organization, subject and content into a dense representation that then a K-Means clustering model uses to identify it to its closest topic (or topic of interest)

As part of this repository, we developed an app that receives request in a webpage and returns the topic predictions.
